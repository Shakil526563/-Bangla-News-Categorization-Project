For large datasets, practice this code on the Kaggle server.Link:https://www.kaggle.com/code/shakilrana202153816/finalmlnlp/edit

Here's a general outline of the steps  consider for our project:

Data Collection: Gather a diverse and representative dataset of Bangla news articles. 
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data. 
Text Representation: Convert the text data into a format that machine learning models can understand. 
Model Selection: Experiment with different machine learning models suitable for text classification. Common models include:
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees,Random Forest,Gradient Boosting,Ada Boost,KNN,MultinomialNB,XGBClassifier etc

Training and Evaluation: Split your dataset into training and testing sets.Train your chosen models on the training set.Evaluate the models on the testing set using
appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).
