Here's a general outline of the steps you might want to consider for your project:

Data Collection:

Gather a diverse and representative dataset of Bangla news articles. 
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the text data. 
Text Representation:

Convert the text data into a format that machine learning models can understand. 
Model Selection:

Experiment with different machine learning models suitable for text classification. Common models include:
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Ada Boost
KNN
MultinomialNB
XGBClassifier

Training and Evaluation:

Split your dataset into training and testing sets.
Train your chosen models on the training set.
Evaluate the models on the testing set using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).
